# Disaster_Analysis_Data_Visualization
Contains Disasters data from 1970-2023.  Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau with an added story. 

After carefully analyzing the data and examining the visualizations, several interesting findings have emerged. Firstly, focusing on the total number of disasters from 1970 to 2021, my analysis and visualizations reveal that floods, storms, epidemics, and earthquakes are the most prevalent types of disasters. Moreover, it is evident that earthquakes, storms, droughts, floods, and epidemics have caused a significant number of deaths.

The mosaic plot provides insights into the impact of these disasters on different continents, with Asia being the most affected region. Additionally, when studying the pattern of disasters over time, there is a noticeable upward trend, indicating an increase in the frequency and intensity of calamities. To further investigate the impact of disasters, I specifically delved into the deaths caused by each type of disaster in various countries. Remarkably, the analysis highlights that earthquakes stand out as the deadliest disaster.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, I conducted in-depth analyses by navigating through each decade and continent, examining the magnitudes associated with earthquakes. These insights shed light on the severity and distribution of earthquakes, contributing to a deeper comprehension of their impact on different regions and time periods.
