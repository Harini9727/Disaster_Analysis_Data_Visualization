The Pixelated Storyteller: Data Visualization of Natural Disasters (1970-2021)

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing disaster data from the "ALL NATURAL DISASTERS 1970-2021 / EOSDIS" dataset available on Kaggle. Our goal was to uncover patterns and relationships within the data and communicate them effectively through visualizations. The dataset includes various types of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, wildfires, and volcanic eruptions, with details like occurrence dates, locations, fatalities, and total damages.

Tools Used
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Tableau, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Interactive Visualizations: Plotly, Dash
- Geographical Visualizations: Folium, Geopandas

Key Insights
1. Frequency of Disasters: Floods were the most frequent natural disaster, followed by storms and epidemics.
2. Fatalities: Earthquakes caused the highest number of fatalities, despite occurring less frequently than floods and storms.
3.  Geographical Distribution: Asia experienced the highest number of disasters, while Oceania had the least. This pattern was consistent across different disaster types.
4.  Temporal Trends : There was an upward trend in the frequency and intensity of disasters over time.
5.  Impact Visualization : Treemaps and heat maps were used to show the relationship between disaster frequency and fatalities, as well as the subsequent calamities caused by primary disasters.

Visualizations
-  Bar Graphs : Displayed the frequency and fatalities of different disaster types.
-  Mosaic Plot : Illustrated the distribution of top disasters across continents.
-  Choropleth Map : Showed the global spread of disasters.
-  Treemap : Represented the relationship between the number of disasters and total deaths.
-  Heat Map : Highlighted subsequent calamities resulting from primary disasters.
-  Interactive Maps and Bubble Charts : Allowed users to explore death counts and disaster impact by selecting specific countries and disaster types.

Final Analysis
Our analysis revealed significant insights into the prevalence and impact of various natural disasters over the past five decades. The findings highlighted the critical areas and disaster types that require more attention for disaster management and preparedness. The interactive visualizations provided an engaging way to explore the data, helping to identify patterns and trends in natural disasters on a global scale.
